# Hand-gesture-volume-control
Traditional volume control via buttons or sliders is inconvenient and not hands-free. This project develops a gesture-based system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand movements, calculate finger distances, and map them to system volume for intuitive, contactless control.
